# UFOs
Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world

## Overview of Project

This project will build a dynamic webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page to display the data related to the UFO sighting information. The available database that we will work on in this project includes countries, cities, states, dates and other information related to UFO sightings. We will also draw on our knowledge of CSS and Bootstrap and explore some Chrome dev tools to test our code as we go. We will start by building a table to hold and neatly display the data we want to work with. Then we will add filters for that table which lets users refine their search on more than one level. Our table will be inserted into and styled the entire page. We will also include an attention-grabbing header an article summary. This assignment is related to the Bootcamp Data Analytics from the University of Toronto.

For data analysis, we will use the database file available called [data.js](https://github.com/DougUOT/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js), 

Follow below the goals for this module:

1) Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
2) A written report on the UFO analysis
